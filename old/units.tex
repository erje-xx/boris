Units for Boris

Landau-Lifshitz Equation
--Saturation magnetization
--Gyromagnetic ratio
The definition and units of the gyromagnetic ratio comes from the ratio's appearance in the the LL equation. If the equations is written as

[with mu0]

as in [examples] the gyromagnetic ratio is defined as [definition] with units of [units]. In this case, the canonical value for YIG is [YIGvalue] and the canonical value for Permalloy is [PYvalue].

On the contrary, if one writes the LL equation as

[without mu0]

as in [examples], the gyromagnetic ratio is defined as [definition] and carries units of [units]. In this case, the canonical value for YIG is [YIGvalue] and the canonical value for Permalloy is [PYvalue].
