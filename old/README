"boris" is a simple python script that numerically calculates the
dispersion of spin-waves in ferromagnetic films. The script comes with
four files (1) README (2) boris.pdf (3) set_the_boris.conf (4)
boris.py.

To use boris, first edit the configuration file
"set_the_boris.conf". Be sure you're working with a python version
>=3.0. At the command line, "$python boris.py" suffices for boris to
read the configuration file and generate his output. Boris writes the
calculated dispersions to "disp.dat" files in boris' working
directory.
