PARAMETERS
# For large values, use scientific notation, i.e. 3.0e-6
# for 3 x 10^6
##########
# Saturation magnetization, Gauss
SATURATION_MAGNETIZATION=1750

# External field, Oersteads
EXTERNAL_FIELD =1964

# Film thickness, meters
FILM_THICKNESS= 0.51e-6

# Film-inplane dimensions for square, step size, meters
FILM_WIDTH = 1.3e-3

# Gyromagnetic ratio, Hz/Oe
GYROMAGNETIC_RATIO = 2.8e6

# Exchange constant, m^2
EXCHANGE_CONSTANT= 3.1e-16

# In-plane angle, degrees
PHI = 0.0

# Angle between film normal and Ms, degrees
# For clarity, THETA = 90.0 corresponds to 
# Ms lying in-plane
# THETA = 90.0 with PHI = 0.0 -> BVMSW
# THETA = 90.0 with PHI = 90.0 -> Damon-Eshbach
THETA = 90.0

# Number of nodes, number of steps of in-plane wavevector
NODE_NUMBER = 100.0
